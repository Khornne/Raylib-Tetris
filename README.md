# Tetris
Created a simple tetris clone using raylib and c++
Doing this project I learnt:
- [x] C++ Object Oriented Programming
- [x] Creating and using my own CMAKE Template

### Build Instructions

Make sure you have CMAKE installed

For Arch

Once CMAKE is installed navigate into the build folder and type *cmake ..* once it is done type *make* 
then there should be executable file you can run called "Tetris" in the build folder
